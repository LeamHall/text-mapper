# Contributing to Phoebe

The simplest way to contribute is to contribute new libraries!

If you have suggestions for the documentation, or code changes, feel
free to contact me by mail: [alex@gnu.org](mailto:alex@gnu.org), or
take a look at the
[alternatives](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact).

I prefer pulling changes from public git repositories, no matter where
they are hosted, but [patches via email](https://git-send-email.io/),
or [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/kensanata/phoebe) work as
well.

As for issues, your options are:

* just send an email (this is the best!)

* send a patch for the `TODO` file

* create a page on my [Software Wiki](https://alexschroeder.ch/software/Text_Mapper)

* create an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/kensanata/text-mapper/issues)

## Commit messages

Use the [packaging] tag to indicate changes that package maintainers
must know about.
